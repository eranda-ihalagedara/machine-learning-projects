# MNIST Classification

## Description  

MNIST dataset stands for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset. It is a large set of labelled images of handwritten digits. Each image is of 28x28 pixels of size in grayscale.
It is already split in to 60000 training images and 10000 test images.
